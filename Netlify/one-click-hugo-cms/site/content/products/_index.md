        Our main product addresses the data needs of modern distributed environments.  Our  products combine
         application specific analytical needs with data persistence. A window into data can be selected for applicability. Once materialized in a view, it can then snapshot as a replayable scenario   in the context of value changes over time.

        Our products consist of a combination of custom hardware and Linux based
        Network Operating systems that integrate accelerated bare-metal networking with container based processing engine. We provide application specific hyper converged solutions for financial, security and bioinformatics markets.

#        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
#        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
#        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
#        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
#        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
